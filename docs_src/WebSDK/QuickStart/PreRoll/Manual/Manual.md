This method allows you much more control over how the pre-roll element is inserted into your page. This method is useful if you are loading parts of your page asynchronously, or modifying your page using Javascript and want to insert the pre-roll element after the initial document load.

Replace the ```__APP_ID__``` and ```__PREROLL_ID__``` with your own and append ```ad.element``` to a container on the page.

In the example provided, the pre-roll element is inserted into the ```div``` with id ```"pre_roll_area"```.
