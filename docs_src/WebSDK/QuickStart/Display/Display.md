Most ad tags use ```document.write``` to write to the page as it is being loaded. If you would like to use this method, follow the [Write](/docs/websdk/Quick Start/Display/Write) instructions below.

SuperAwesome's Web SDK also presents the option of creating an ad element and placing it after the page has loaded - this is preferable if the ad needs to be placed within a container that is generated using Javascript or in a template that is loaded asynchronously. If you would like to use this method, follow the [Manual Placement](/docs/websdk/Quick Start/Display/Manual Placement) instructions below.
