This method allows you much more control over how the placement is inserted into your page. This method is useful if you are loading parts of your page asynchronously, or modifying your page using Javascript and want to insert the placement after the initial document load.

To use this method, replace the ```__APP_ID__``` and ```__PLACEMENT_ID__``` with your own and append ```ad.element``` to a container on the page.

In the example provided, the placement is inserted into the ```div``` with id ```"ad_area"```.
