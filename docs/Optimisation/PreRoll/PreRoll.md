By default, the pre-roll player is not loaded by the SuperAwesome Web SDK. This is to reduce loading times for pages that only use display ads.

To pre-fetch the pre-roll player, specify ```pre_roll=true``` in the script tag address.

__Any example in this documentation that only shows display ads will not pre-fetch the pre-roll player, however all pre-roll examples will.__
